When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

  When I need to work on my project using different computers, or when I
  think my colleagues can help with my project and they are working using
  their own computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  First, if automatic pull is used, I would always need internet connection
  to be on. Second, changes from team members are not that frequent.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

  Forks are repository clones that is put in Github. Clones are copy of
  repositories, either put in Github through forking, or by using git clone
  command. Branches are collection of commits.
