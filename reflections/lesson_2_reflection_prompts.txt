What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git creates a special directory, called ".git" for storing its meta data
  about the content of the folder at the time it is initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  repository. If I change my mind, I can "undo" the process and get my
  files back out from staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  Git provides diff command to make sure necessary changes is applied to
  the files in working directory and staging area. When the changes are
  confirmed, I can commit the changes to the repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Branches will help when I think of new features those are not part of
  official version of development. This way, the master branch can be used
  as usual without being disturbed by new experimental features.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  For me the diagrams is a simple tree-like structure that store changes
  and commits along the line. In one way, it helps to pin point which
  branches has been made.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
